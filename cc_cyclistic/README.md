## Colin Coyne's Data Analysis Portfolio - Bike Trip Analysis for Cyclistic

This is the case study for one of Coursera / Google's Data Analytics Professional Certificate capstone projects.

Cyclistic is a fictional bike sharing company based that operate in Chicago, USA.

The executive team is on the lookout for ways to drive growth and is considering a marketing strategy that aims to convert a large portion of casual riders into members.

As a junior data analyst on Cyclistic's marketing analytics team, I've been tasked with presenting to executives my findings and recommendations once I've thoroughly explored, processed and analyzed any relevant data.

The analysis shows the 6 main stages of the full Data Analysis life-cycle 
### ASK, PREPARE, PROCESS, ANALYZE, SHARE, and ACT
